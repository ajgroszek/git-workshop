Summary of  git workshop
------------------------

1. "Forked" Ben's repository to copy it to my github account.
2. "Cloned" the remote version of my repository to my local machine.
3. Made some edits to the local repository (added files etc.)
4. "Staged" and then "committed" these changes to the repository.
5. "Pushed" these changes back to the remote repository. This required a sign-in code (if doing from command line, this needs an ssh key pair)
6. Edited a file remotely.
7. "Fetched" the remote changes, downloading them to my local repository.
8. Created a new branch, and moved to it.
9. Created a new file while in the new branch.
10. Tested moving back to "main" branch, and seeing that the new file disappeared from the folder in explorer.
